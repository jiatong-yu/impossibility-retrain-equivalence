# Figures & Regeneration

- History dependence of unlearning across paths `p` (log-likelihood trajectories)
- Forget score / utility tradeoffs by algorithm and model size
- Superficial vs. deep forgetting case study

To regenerate figures, log the above metrics per unlearning step and produce line plots. Place scripts under `src/experiments/` and export to `results/`.
